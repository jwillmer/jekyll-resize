## Sample usage

Add the plugin gem to your Gemfile as below, then install it with Bundler.

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-resize", git: "https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-resize"
end
```

The `resize` filter will be available in Liquid (in your Markdown and HTML) so you can use it for a JPEG or PNG file.

Here we resize an image to max width and max height of 800 pixels and converting it to webp with an image quality of 80:

```liquid
{{ "my-image.png" | resize: "800x800>,webp,80" }}
```

Here we resize an image to max width and max height of 800 pixels with an image quality of 80:

```liquid
{{ "my-image.png" | resize: "800x800>,,80" }}
```

Here we resize an image to max width and max height of 800 pixels and converting it to webp:

```liquid
{{ "my-image.png" | resize: "800x800>,webp" }}
```

Here we resize an image to max width and max height of 800 pixels:

```liquid
{{ "my-image.png" | resize: "800x800>" }}
```

That takes care of:

- _generating_ the reduced image.
- providing a _link_ to the file.

See the docs linked below for a more detailed example using the filter with an HTML `img` tag.
